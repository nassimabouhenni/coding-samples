The Tableau visualization I created contains 3 sheets and 3 breakdowns of parts of the data:

Sheet 1: Snow + Regions
This Sheet tracks state snowfall averages across the United States. I further clustered them, and found that
snow fall tracks well with the regions in the United States (Midwest, West, New England/East Coast, South),
which I found interesting.

Sheet 2: Temperature Variation
This Sheet tracks temperature variation across states, tracking how the minimum and maximum temperature
correlate with the average temperature. The United States has a relatively temperate climate so the R^2 values
were high (.97 and .93, respectively). Additionally, the IQR plots for minimum and maximum temperature 
are fairly similar with the IQR plot of the minimum temperature quartiles being consistenly ~20F less 
than that of the maximum temperature. This is with the exception of the upper whisker of the minimum 
temperature, which was much higher.

Sheet 3: Elevation and Weather Stations
This Sheet tracks the density of weather stations with elevation. Many of the weather stations were located
in the Rocky Mountains out west, which might indicate regional bias in the data, presumably for reasons related
to weather measurement collection and elevation.
